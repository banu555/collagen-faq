                            A lot of companies take a “jack of all trades” approach to collagen by throwing in a bunch of different types, and claiming their product 
                            will help everything — muscles, joints, and skin. But you know what they say, right? A jack of all trades is a master of none.
                            <br /><br />
                           Rather than trying to do everything at once, which just isn’t realistic from a supplement, we chose to focus on one thing and do it right.
                           Eighty percent of the collagen in your skin is type 1 so we focused on creating a truly effective skin collagen formula, by including the
                           right type of collagen, from the right source (we use a marine source, which has a lower molecular weight, making it better absorbed by the body).
                           <br /><br />
                           Instead of adding other types of collagen and having no room to fortify our collagen blend and make it really effective, we chose to
                           add additional support ingredients that both boost natural collagen production and protect our skin's 
                           collagen from environmental toxins. Anthocyanins (found in the 3 berry extracts in our support ingredient list)
                           have high antioxidant activities and support collagen synthesis by shielding collagen producing cells 
                           from damaging environmental and lifestyle factors. They are vital for any 'beauty from within' product. Berries that we use include blueberry, 
                           currant, and crowberry extracts, all containing various collagen producing and protecting properties.

                             Our Smarter Skin Collagen was clinically tested by dermatologists, who objectively measured changes in wrinkles, pore size, age spots, and skin texture over the course of the study. The changes in skin appearance came more quickly than expected, with results coming in weeks, not months, and getting better over time. Here’s a brief overview of the amazing results:
                             <br /><br />
                           
                                In just 3 weeks 41% of participants showed improved skin texture, and at 7 weeks, 81% showed improved skin texture.
                             <br /><br />
                          
                             In just 4 weeks there was a significant reduction in wrinkles, decreased age spots, and improvements in overall look of facial skin, with a brighter appearance.

                           The flavor in our current formulation actually serves an important purpose. The natural berry flavor comes from our important collagen-producing and protecting support ingredients such as blueberry, black currant, crowberry (and several others) which support collagen synthesis by shielding collagen producing cells from damaging environmental and lifestyle factors. Called the "internal sunscreens", these berries provide potent protection against inflammation and DNA damage from the sun, poor diet, and other external factors. So the flavor in our product is an essential part of what makes our triple-action blend so powerful.

                            In our twenties we begin to decrease collagen production by 1.5% every year and it is decreased by 50% by the time we are 60. So, starting early is key to preventing signs of aging from occuring in our skin and keep our skin looking young, bright, 
                            and wrinkle free for longer. That being said, there is no age too old to begin replacing and protecting your skin's collagen. Just because you didn’t start at 20, doesn’t mean you can’t start now!
